Clarity brings smart contracts to Bitcoin. It is a decidable language, meaning you can know, with certainty, from the code itself what
the program will do. Clarity is interpreted (not compiled) & the source code is published on the blockchain.
Clarity gives developers a safe way to build complex smart contracts for the world's most secure blockchain.

# How to run clearn
* You can run clearn on replit: <a href="https://replit.com/@teekayy/clearn">Run on Replit</a>
* If you wish to run clearn on your own machine, you can build the binary using `make build-ctl` & run clearn using `build/clearn watch`

# Doing exercises
All exercises can be found in the `exercises` folder.

The solutions to all these exercises can be found in the `solutions` folder.

Once clearn is running, you will have to edit various `.clar` files to complete your exercises.
The `.clar` extension is for Clarity files. All exercises have compilation errors, and a few of them have tests to check whether you have
completed the exercise as expected.
There will be hints for all compilation errors as well as tests.
On saving these `.clar` files, clearn will automatically compile and run tests (if any).
If you're running clearn on replit, files are autosaved.

Best of luck!
